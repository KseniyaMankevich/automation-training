All the leaves are brown
And the sky is grey
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A.
California dreaming
On such a winter's day

I stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees
And I pretend to pray

You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
California Dreamin'
On such a winter's day

All the leaves are brown
And the sky is grey
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day

If I didn't go
I could leave today
California Dreamin'
On such a winter's day
On such a winter's day
On such a winter's day
